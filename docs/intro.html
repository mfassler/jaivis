<center><h2>Jabber + VTK = Jaivis.</h2></center>
<hr>
<h4>
Prerequisites
</h4>
</hr>
<p>
Jaivis requires:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a> (including the Python bindings) </li>
  <li> <a href="http://numeric.scipy.org/">numpy</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a> or netcat (or simlar to talk to Unix domain sockets) </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You might need to change some pathnames.  Edit this file:
<pre>
  jv/jvPaths.py
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To launch Jaivis:
<pre>
$ python jaivis.py VirtualWorldForPeople
</pre>

</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>
<p>
You can move around inside Jaivis.  Right now the movement is videogame-style:<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<table border="0" width="700px">
<tr>
  <td align="center">
    Left hand<br>
    on the keyboard<br>
    to move:
  </td>
  <td align="center">
    Press-and-hold<br>
    the middle mouse button<br>
     to look around:
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center">
    <img src="keyboard-controls.png" border="0"/>
  </td>
  <td align="center">
    <img src="mouse.png" border="0"/>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<h4>Architecture</h4>

<p>
Jaivis is built on top of VTK <small>(The <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">Visualization Toolkit</a>)</small> which
is built on top of OpenGL:
<center>
<img src="jaivis-basic.png" border="0"/>
</center>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Another wrapper on top of VTK?&nbsp; Jaivis adds a couple things to VTK: 
an animation loop and a custom interactor <small>(via vtkRenderWindowInteractor())</small>.  This
allows you to move around inside of your visualization.  
<br>
<br>
If you know Python and VTK, it's possible to create your own interactor.  Jaivis
isn't married to any particular style of interaction.
</p>
<br>
<p>
There are three major interfaces:
<ul>
<li>Jaivis is controlled via interactive socket (Unix domain socket).  The language is RESTful (-ish).</li>
<li>Jaivis loads visualizations via an XML file format.</li>
<li>Jaivis communicates with other Jaivis clients via UDP.</li>
</ul>

<h4>RESTful-ish Control</h4>
<p>
Most of Jaivis's behavior is controlled through a Unix domain socket.
I like to use "socat" to control Jaivis.  For example: 
<pre>
$ socat READLINE UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/jv-wazza
</pre>
this should give you a nice, GNU-readline-style interface to Jaivis.  
</p>
<p>
From socat, you can type commands to Jaivis:
<pre>
> GET maps
BeachSunset
CompassRose

</pre>
</p>
<p>
You can put text onto the 4-line On-Screen Display:
<pre>
> POST osd Hello, My name is Inigo Montoya!
</pre>
<p>

<p>
Let's load and remove some maps:
<pre>
> REMOVE maps/BeachSunset
</pre>
You should see only the compass rose at the origin.  Let's add the beach again:
<pre>
> LOAD map BeachSunset
 Jaivis/1.0 200 OK
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Loading a map twice should generate an error:
<pre>
> LOAD map BeachSunset
 Map BeachSunset already exists.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Let's add a bar to the beach:
<pre>
> LOAD map TheLaughingMan
 Jaivis/1.0 200 OK
</pre>
<img src="screenshots/second-with-bar.png" border="0"/>

</p>

<p>
Let's add a bartender:
<pre>
> LOAD character jid:bartender@jabber.org race:MechAngel
 Jaivis/1.0 200 OK
</pre>
By default, he's sitting at the origin, underneath the floor,
so let's move him to the bar:
<pre>
> MOVE characters/bartender@jabber.org x:2.2 y:0.2 z:2.3
>
</pre>
Note that he's facing away from the customers.  By default,
characters are created facing north.  Let's turn him so that he's
facing the customers:
<pre>
> ROTATE characters/bartender@jabber.org theta:180
>
</pre>
<img src="screenshots/bar-with-bartender.png" border="0"/><br>
(Note that theta is the negative of compass direction.)
</p>
<p>
More stuff:
<pre>
> GET characters
username@jabber.org
bartender@jabber.org
> REMOVE characters/bartender@jabber.org
>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
A position can be specified when you first load a character.  Let's
put the bartender on the stage:
<pre>
> LOAD character jid:bartender@jabber.org race:MechAngel x:4.5 y:-17.0 z:2.2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Using socat's READLINE interface, you can use the up-arrow to go back to previous commands.  
This makes it easier to tinker while making changes to your maps and avatars.

<h4>XML File Format</h4>
<p>
You use XML to describe your VTK pipelines.  My goal is to 
follow VTK's naming conventions and structures as closely as possible 
in the file format.  This is usually possible, but not always. <small>(XML is
a strict tree structure, whereas VTK is a little bit more flexible
than that.)</small>
</p>
<p>
Example XML file:<br>
<pre>
  &lt;VTKpipelines&gt;

    &lt;Actor name="origin" SetColor="1, 0.3, 0.4"&gt;
      &lt;PolyDataMapper&gt;
        &lt;SphereSource SetRadius="0.1"/&gt;
      &lt;/PolyDataMapper&gt;
    &lt;/Actor&gt;

  &lt;/VTKpipelines&gt;
</pre>
<br>
Notes on the format:
<ul>
  <li>One-to-one naming:
    <ul>
      <li>The &lt;SphereSource&gt; element <small>(in XML)</small> calls the vtkSphereSource() class <small>(in running code)</small>.</li>
      <li>The &lt;PolyDataMapper&gt; element calls the vtkPolyDataMapper() class.</li>
      <li>The &lt;Actor&gt; element calls the vtkActor() class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br><li>Typically, the attributes of an element call the member functions of the class.  For example:
    <ul>
      <li>In &lt;SphereSource&gt;, the "SetRadius" attribute calls the SetRadius() member function.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br><li>The &lt;Actor&gt; element has a "name" attribute.  All 1st-level elements <small>(ie, 
the root-level elements contained inside the &lt;VTKpipelines&gt; element)</small> must be named.
This allows us to reference some elements by name (ie, a variable name) which allows us
to break the rigid XML tree structure when necessary.</li>
  <br><li>Any item that supports the "SetColor" attribute also supports a "color" attribute.
    <ul>
      <li>"SetColor" uses VTK's color convention (eg, white:  SetColor="1.0, 1.0, 1.0")</li>
      <li>"color" uses the WWW color convention (eg, white:  color="#ffffff").</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Future Ideas</h4>

<p>
In the long-run, I'd like to make things much more general and abstract:
<ul>
  <li>
    Individual JIDs could be programs running physics simulations,
    displaying their results into the Jaivis (ie, VTK) window. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Or you could make a flight simulator.  A person's avatar
    would be an airplane, simulating physics.
  </li>
  <li>
   Or something really strange and abstract:  a person's avatar
   could be some glowing fog, or a swarm of bees...  avatars might
   interact with each other via electromagnetic fields.
  </li>
  <li>
   Individual JIDs could be daemons on your servers, monitoring
   their health.  Their avatars could be graphs and pie charts.
   You could walk around a 3-D world of displays and gauges showing
   how your datacenter is doing.
  </li>
  <li>
   Personally, I'd like to make the animations and gestures of
   (human-looking) avatars be controlled by neural networks
   simulating spinal reflexes and the like.
  </li>
</ul>
