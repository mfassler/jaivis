###  This are my thinking-out-loud ramblings about how I might want
###  the Jaivis protocol look to Jabber...
###

## From the chatroom server:

<jaivis
	action="session-initiate"
        viewertype="People"
	physics="none"
	collisiondetection="none">
		<map><uri>http://somewhere.com/jaivis-maps/TLM-bar.xml</uri></map>
</jaivis>

##  viewertype
#
# I imagine a few different possible viewertypes:
#
#   "People"  --  people walking around in a virtual world, similar to
#                 SecondLife
#   "Flight Simulator" -- for flying airplanes.  The "characters" are
#                         different airplanes
#   "Space Fleet"  -- a "character" is a swarm of spaceships
#   "Plasma"  -- a "character" is a swarm of glowing balls that streak
#                through space (like those cool OpenGL screensavers).


##  physics
#
# I imagine that the jaivis software would come with handful of different
# physics engines, eg:  "Simple Newtonian", "Newtonian--Low gravity".
#


##  collisiondetection
#
# Code still needs to be written for collision detection.  Perhaps
# there might be a couple different ways to do collision detection...



## From each user:

<jaivis
	action="session-join">
		<avatar>Human</avatar>
		<transport>
			<candidate
				ip="10.0.0.1"
				protocol="udp"
				port="23421"/>
		</transport>
</jaivis>

# ... and all the users would send and receive UDP packet to and from
# each other.  The UDP packets wouldn't necessarily have to go through
# the server.  (Although, for video games, you might want to have all
# the packets go through the server for verification -- ie, the server
# has one "official" list of who is where, and the server makes sure
# that all the clients are following the laws of physics.)
