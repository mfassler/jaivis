    Jabber + VTK = Jaivis


INTRO
-----

Jabber is a *really cool* open-source, decentralized IM system.

VTK (Visualization Toolkit) is a *really cool* open-source, 3D 
visualization system built on top of OpenGL.  

I think that it would be *really cool* if VTK was connected to 
Jabber.

For my first, real-world application of this idea, I'm trying to 
create a 3D, virtual-reality-type world, kind of like SecondLife, 
except on a much, much smaller scale.  Jabber can already do pretty 
much everything except the graphics.



REQUIREMENTS
------------

You'll need to have the following software installed:
  python
  vtk
  vtk-python
  numpy
  socat or netcat or similar
(I like to use socat to interact with Unix domain sockets.)



QUICKSTART
----------
You might need to change some pathnames:
   edit:  jv/jvPaths.py


To start the 3-D world, type:

   python jaivis.py VirtualWorldForPeople

To look around:

   [Middle Mouse Click] + MouseMove
     (ie, hold down the middle button on your mouse and move the mouse 
          to look around)

To move:

   These keys form an arrow pad:

           E
          SDF

          E - Forward
          D - Back
          S - Strafe left
          F - Strafe right

   There's also:
          T - Float up
          G - Float down
          H - toggle headlights
          W - toggle wireframe
          O - "out-of-body" perspective
